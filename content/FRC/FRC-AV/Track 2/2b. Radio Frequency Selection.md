1. On the streaming unit computer, open the Wireless Workbench software.
2. Click the "Open Show" button, which has a folder icon.
3. Navigate to the Syncthing folder, which should be pinned on the left-side toolbar. Then navigate to the FRC events directory (e.g., 2025-FRC), and the folder with this event's code. Select the .shw file with the event code on it, e.g., 2025CHCMP.
4. Verify that all mic receivers are online with the software using the Inventory mode.

>  If you see this on any receivers, check that the receiver is powered on and that the Ethernet icon  ![[FRC/FRC-AV/Track 2/Media/ethernet-icon.webp]] is lit up on the screen of the receiver. Restart Wireless Workbench if you identify and fix any issues.
5. Switch to the Frequency Coordination mode and initiate a site scan. **The mic antenna must be connected for this to function properly. This should have already been completed.**
