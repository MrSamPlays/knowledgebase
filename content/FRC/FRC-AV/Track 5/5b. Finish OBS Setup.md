2. Double-click on the Window Capture source. This may be named something different, but the icon should be identical to the one shown above. Re-select the "Window" in the menu that opens up with the "AudienceDisplay.exe" option. Click OK. ![[FRC/FRC-AV/Track 5/Media/image-2.png]]
3. Navigate to the "MAIN" scene and verify that all camera inputs are populated as expected. Check cable connections if any are not operating as expected. A disconnected cable is the most common source of no video. A faulty cable is also a potential culprit.
4. Navigate to the FMS Video Switch by opening [this link](http://10.0.100.5/VideoSwitch) on the Streaming Unit. You can also open the [main FMS Website](http://10.0.100.5) and click "Video Switch" at the top.
5. Click "Wifi Reminder" and verify that the output from the Audience Display shows over the camera feed.
6. Click "Video Only" and verify that the camera feed shows through.
