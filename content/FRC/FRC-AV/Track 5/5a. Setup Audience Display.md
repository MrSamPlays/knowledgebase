> [!steps]+ These Steps Not Always Necessary
> If you know or have been told that there was no update to the FMS for the event you are running, these steps can be skipped. However, if the FMS has been updated, or you are unsure, the safest option is to carry them out. This will ensure that the latest available version of the Audience Display application is running.
> 1. Proceed to the FMS Web interface (bookmarked in Chrome or via [this link](http://10.0.100.5/FRCDownloads) ) and click on "Downloads" along the top bar. The link above only works on the Streaming Unit computer when connected to the FMS network.
> 2. Select the first option for "Audience Display Installer".

> 3. Open the exe file, selecting the option to "Run anyway" if Windows complains. 
> 4. Proceed through the prompts to update the Audience Display application.

1. On the desktop, or using the search bar, search for "Primary Display".
2. Once the window opens up, hold the CTRL and SHIFT buttons, then press C and release all three buttons. 
3. After a few seconds, a configuration window should appear.
4. Verify that the following settings are present. The settings are listed first by the category, shown along the top, then by the group of settings within the category if applicable, then finally the setting and value itself.
	- General
		- Resolution: 1080p
	- Graphics
		- Display Types
			- Preset Types: Start by setting to "Live Stream Display", though this may change to "Custom Settings" later.
		- Score Display Orientation
			- Horizontal Orientation: Red on Right
			- Vertical Orientation: \[Consult with Equipment Manager, venue-specific]
	- Automation
		- Animation Rendering Optimization: Allow Window Capture
		- Enable OBS Integration: Clear checkbox (disable)
		- Enable Bitfocus Companion Integration: Clear checkbox (disable)
	- Shortcuts
		No settings to change here, but it is a handy list of shortcuts that you can use to more easily work with the application.
5. Press the blue "Save and Close" button. Once the panel closes, hold CTRL and SHIFT, then press the number 2 and release all three keys. This will move the Audience Display to a second screen that is invisible to you. If you need to bring it back in the future, click the FRC icon in the taskbar to bring the window in focus and hold CTRL and SHIFT, then press the number 1 and release all three keys.
Stage 5a is complete. Typically, the next step is to complete [[FRC/FRC-AV/Track 5/5b. Finish OBS Setup|Stage 5b]].
