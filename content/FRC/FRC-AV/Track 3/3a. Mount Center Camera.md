Supplies needed: 16' tripod, ball head joint.
1. Locate the Center Camera in the [Storage Case](FRC/FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions). It is located in the third drawer, marked "Cameras".

 3.  Locate a ball head joint. These are located in the same drawer as the cameras. 
 4. Mount the ball head joint to the screw thread on the tall tripod, and the camera to the ball head joint. Tighten until camera is secure and pointed relatively at the field. Don't raise the camera just yet. ![[FRC/FRC-AV/Track 3/Media/IMG_4850 (1).webp]]
 5. Remove the front lens cap by gently pinching the two tabs towards the center of the lens cap.![[FRC/FRC-AV/Track 3/Media/IMG_20250222_161511.jpg]]

> [!Info] Don't lose the lens cap!
>  Be sure to place the lens cap back in the Camera drawer of the Storage Case so it does not get lost.

 6. Extend the legs on the tripod so that they lay stably on the floor (i.e., the center joint is off of the ground). A sandbag (found in the [AV case](FRC/FRC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions)) can be used to attach to the center joint and stabilize further, if needed.
Stage 3a is complete. [[FRC/FRC-AV/Track 3/3b. Mount and Cable Alliance Cameras|Proceed to stage 3b.]]
