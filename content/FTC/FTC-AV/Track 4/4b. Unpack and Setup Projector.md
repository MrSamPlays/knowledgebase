>6. The app allows for setup either projected onto a wall or onto a screen. Since we are using a screen, select this option to proceed with setup.
>7. Analyze the screen shape and compare it with that presented in the app. If the image is very crooked or keystoned, make manual adjustments to improve the baseline image's shape.
>8. Take a picture of the pattern, ensuring that the full pattern and screen is captured. Follow prompts in the app.

Press the "Finish" button here, as we will not adjust the image further.

9. If the screen is located in an area where patrons or teams may run into or lean against the projector or screen, place pipe and drape around the screen and projector to lessen the chances of collisions.
