6. After the receiver conducts the scan, verify that it reports that there are 6 receivers present. If it does not, check that all receivers are powered on and that the Ethernet icon ![[FTC/FTC-AV/Track 2/Media/ethernet-icon.webp]] is lit up on the top-right of the receiver's screen. Hit 'exit' repeatedly to return to the home screen and restart the process if you find or fix any issues.
