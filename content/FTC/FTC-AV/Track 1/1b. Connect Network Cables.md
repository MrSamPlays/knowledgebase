Equipment needed: Ethernet roll/spool, 2x long Ethernet cable.

1. Retrieve the Ethernet roll. It should be located in the [AV tote](FTC/FTC-AV/index.md#Equipment%20Locations%20and%20Storage%20Descriptions) marked Ethernet (large spool). In some cases, however, it may have been placed loose in the pods, or in another AV tote. In this case, it may take some sleuthing around the staging area of all of the cases to determine its location.
2. If venue Ethernet port has not been located, work with Equipment Manager and/or venue personnel to locate. Run cable from venue location to Streaming Unit. Make sure the spool ends up in the AV area to prevent trip hazards.
3. Plug venue Ethernet into "Internet In" Ethernet port on the Streaming Unit, marked in red below.
