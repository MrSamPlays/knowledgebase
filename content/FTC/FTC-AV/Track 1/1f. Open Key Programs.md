Supplies needed: None.

Start by opening Syncthing and syncing the media cache.
1. Open the Syncthing interface by navigating to [http://locahost:8384](http://locahost:8384/) (this link will only work on a machine that has Syncthing running).
2. Verify that at least one peer is connected and sync media.

> - Check the right-side column labeled "Remote Devices". At least one device in this list needs to have the word "Connected" or "Up to Date" listed next to it. The screenshot above shows a successful connection.
> 	- If no devices are listed as "Connected", start by verifying basic Internet connectivity (refer to [[FTC/FTC-AV/Track 1/1d. Test Connectivity|1d. Test Connectivity]] or [[FTC/FTC-AV/Track 1/1e. Troubleshoot Connectivity Issues|1e. Troubleshoot Network Connectivity Issues]] if necessary). If basic Internet connectivity is present, it is likely that the Syncthing traffic is being blocked by the school's firewalls. If possible, work with venue IT staff to unblock the traffic, otherwise it may be necessary to temporarily utilize a hotspot to successfully sync. Consult with the FTA or Equipment Manager if you believe Syncthing is being blocked. 
> 	
> - Wait a few minutes once connection to at least one peer is established. Syncthing will automatically scan for changes and download them to the computer if necessary. You can leave this in the background while continuing on with setup.
