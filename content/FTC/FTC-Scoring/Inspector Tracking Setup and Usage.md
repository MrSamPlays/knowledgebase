# For Scorekeepers:

> [!Warning] Warning
> Changing any of these settings after robot inspection has started will clear the history of teams that were inspected. Make sure to set this up before the LRI opens inspections up to teams.

1. Click on the dropdown menu Event admin (make sure you are logged in as a user with event admin permissions or none of this will work) In our example, our event is named uschsfake_2 ![[Event_dashboard_location_snippet.webp]]
2. From the event dashboard go to configure judging/inspection tracking
3. Your screen should look something like below. While this example is set up for a dual division event, your screen should look similar for a single division event.

4. Make sure to check the boxes as shown above (Check Robot Inspection box and Enable READY state queue). Leave all other boxes unchecked (unless you want to show everyone who is checked in and has completed judging)
5. Verify by logging in as a lead robot inspector and going to the lead robot inspector override section for robot inspection. Marking teams as ready should show a queue interface with the number of teams in queue.
>[!note] Dual Division Events
> You will need to do these steps for each division and not just the overall event.

# For Lead Robot Inspectors
1. Once the scorekeeper has enabled inspection tracking as described above, you can enter the lead inspector override found on the top right corner (if you don't see it, you are not logged in as a lead inspector). ![[FTC-Live_lri_override_annotated.png]]
2. If your interface looks something like this, you're on the right track. You should be able to click on the dropdowns and add teams to the ready queue. ![[FTC-Live_lri_override_interface_annotated.png]]
3. The order in which you mark teams as ready matters, since that is the order it will show up on the pit display. In the below example, I marked team 999998 as ready first so it shows up with the number 1. ![[FTC-Live_pit_display_sample.webp]]
4. Dual-Division events (Championships) have separate inspection tracking for each division so you will need to open two tabs, one for each division and flip between the two.
