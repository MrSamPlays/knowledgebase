This category of the knowledgebase features setup articles for specific aspects of the FTC scoring system that may require more detailed instructions than currently available, based on the experience of senior volunteers in the Chesapeake region. 
**These articles are not comprehensive setup documentation!** A full setup guide for FTCLive and the FTC Scoring system is available at https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/ftc/event/scoring-setup. 
While we make every effort to ensure these guides are in agreement with the official docs, if any of these guides conflict with those instructions, the official documentation shall prevail. If inconsistencies are observed, please let us know by filing an issue on the [knowledgebase repository](https://github.com/FIRSTChesapeake/knowledgebase/issues). Requests for additional guides are also welcomed and should be filed in the same location.
The following guides are currently available:
# [[Inspector Tracking Setup and Usage]]
# [[Field Timer (Raspberry Pi) Setup]]
